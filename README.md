## ðŸ”Ž Key Findings

* Happiness scores range from **2.85 to 7.77**, with most countries scoring between **4.5 and 6.5**.
* The **top-ranked countries** include Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.
* The **bottom-ranked countries** include South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Afghanistan.
* A **strong positive correlation (\~0.79)** was found between GDP per capita and happiness score.
* Some countries, like **South Korea** and **Japan**, showed high GDP but relatively lower happiness.
* Others, like **Guatemala**, scored higher in happiness despite modest GDP, thanks to strong social bonds and life satisfaction.

### ðŸ§  Conclusion
The 2019 World Happiness Report highlights that happiness is not solely dependent on a nationâ€™s wealth. While a higher GDP per capita generally correlates with greater happiness, it's clear that other dimensions like community strength, health, freedom, and trust have equally powerful effects. Countries aiming to improve citizen well-being must adopt balanced, people-centric policies that go beyond economic indicators to cultivate a more supportive, fair, and fulfilling environment for all.
