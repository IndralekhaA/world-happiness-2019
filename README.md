## ðŸ”Ž Key Findings

* Happiness scores range from **2.85 to 7.77**, with most countries scoring between **4.5 and 6.5**.
* The **top-ranked countries** include Finland, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.
* The **bottom-ranked countries** include South Sudan, Central African Republic, and Afghanistan.
* A **strong positive correlation (\~0.79)** was found between GDP per capita and happiness score.
